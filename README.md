# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

This project includes mutiple html and css concepts that are created with a refactored file structure in mind that will ensure organization of the project into a format that will be readable to other programmers. In this project, the concepts are as follows:

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

As with most projects, the continuing evolution of said project is always in play. For instance, perhaps we could make the menu more responsive by adding links to the menu items or make the form more dramatic and edgy by adding animations:)
